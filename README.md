# Professional-Portfolio
Bootcamp Portfolio (challenge #2)
This is my personal web dev portfolio.
It has many primary features like:
-link creation to navigate the ui.
-a sticky banner that makes navigation simplier and quicker.
-multible images with intended link creation that will guide you to other samples of my work.
-and most importantly, a contact and hyperlinks area so that I can be reached.

The application can be found here:
